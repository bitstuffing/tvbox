TV BOX video plugin for Kodi for learning people, it's completely free, it has no ads and if you get it from a page with 
advertising or pay for it, you are insane.

the use of Kodi, because it's the best app ever done, but it hasn't support for a decent web browser.

it's ilegal in your country, please go to the people who offer this content. The developers of this software are
